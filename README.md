Sample implementation of natural language image search with OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and Elasticsearch.

![Demo](demo.png)

Inspired by https://github.com/haltakov/natural-language-image-search.

My goal here is testing various approach for image search on elasticsearch, and combining image search with other search criteria.

## TODO

- Speed up search with [elastiknn](https://github.com/alexklibisz/elastiknn)
- Explain architecture
- Add image indexing onn the fly
- Publish scripts used to compute image features
- Write local dev guide

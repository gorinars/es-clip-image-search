Sample implementation of natural language image search with OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and Elasticsearch.

![Demo](demo.png)

Inspired by https://github.com/haltakov/natural-language-image-search.

My focus here is more running testing it on elasticsearch, and combining image search with other search criteria.

The setup will also be useful to see how faster it can be when it will be distributed in an ES cluster.

## TODO

Explain architecture
And deploy demo
